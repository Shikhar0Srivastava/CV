      <p>A human being. Not something I enjoy being but oh well. I solve rubik's cubes and read and watch anime and manga. It's kind of sad that there is nothing more to my personality. I prefer movies over tv series because I like my stories concluded. I used to think I have elite music taste but now I think it's actually pretty shit. I'm studying engineering and I don't particularly like it. I want to leave my country asap but I frankly don't think its possible. The act of living is seeming more and more meaningless as days pass by. Also, contrary to what I said earlier, I <em>am</em> currently watching Game of Thrones. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail this semester and I don't have the slightest idea of what to tell my parents.</p></td>
